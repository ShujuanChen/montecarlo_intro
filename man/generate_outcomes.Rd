\title{Generate treatment levels and outcomes from covariates.}
\usage{
generate_outcomes(X, beta_a, beta_y, effect_size = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n-by-p matrix of covariate data.}

\item{beta_a}{Vector of logistic coefficients of length p, relating the
propensity scores to X by the equation \eqn{\pi(X) = expit(X^T \beta_a)}.}

\item{beta_y}{Vector of linear coefficients of length p, relating the outcome
Y to X by the equation \eqn{\mu(X, a) = X^T \beta_y}.}

\item{effect_size}{The treatment effect, which is constant.}
}
\value{
A list containing the treatments A and the outcomes Y, each of length
n.
}
\description{
Propensity scores \eqn{\pi(X) := P(A = 1|X)} are a logistic function of the
covariates X. The treatment A is binary, 0 or 1. The outcomes
\eqn{\mu(X, a) := E[Y|X, A = a]}, for \eqn{a \in {0, 1}}, are linear in
the covariates, plus independent Gaussian noise, plus a constant treatment
effect for those who received treatment. Given this structure, the treatment
and the potential outcomes are independent conditional on X, but not
marginally because X confounds the treatment and the outcome.
