Description: This package accompanies the paper "Valid Causal Effect Estimates
    with Machine Learning Algorithms," by Ashley Naimi, Edward Kennedy, and Alan
    Mishler. It implements simulations and visualizations to illustrate the
    estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (aka Average Causal Effect)
    via singly and doubly robust estimators, using parametric and nonparametric
    estimators of the nuisance propensity scores and outcome regressions.
