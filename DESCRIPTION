Description: This package accompanies the paper "Challenges in Obtaining Valid
    Causal Effect Estimates with Machine Learning Algorithms," by Ashley Naimi,
    Alan Mishler, and Edward Kennedy (https: //arxiv.org/abs/1711.07137). It
    implements simulations and visualizations to illustrate the estimation of
    the Average Treatment Effect (aka Average Causal Effect) via singly and
    doubly robust estimators, using parametric and nonparametric estimators of
    the nuisance propensity scores and outcome regressions.
